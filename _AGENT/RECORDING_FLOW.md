User configures his recording beforeend and press start recording.
It waits 3 seconds.
Overlay appears on the screen (the timer with pause/stop AND the camera overlay if screen record and camera are both turned on).
IF camera is on and screen is off, camera takes the whole screen space on the video.
IF camera is on and screen is on as well, we stream the camera to an overlay on the screen, and we actually only take the screen record for the final video (and optional audio if its on of course).
At the end of the recording, we merge audio and video into one if both are on.
End video is saved to the location saved in settings.
